# Version 2.1 of the CoM

Input: CoM_V2.dta as posted to ICPSR

## Changes

1. Revisions to county codes  by Andrew Holt.

**Note**: The variable ag003_fips is the 1930s county code so you should not attempt to merge with data that has modern county FIPS codes. Instead you should use ag003_fips_cpp, which is a consistent one over time.

2. Geographic merging to V2 of the CPP dataset.
3. Fixes to firm identifies in ice industry based on primary source records.
4. Relabeled a handful of variables.
