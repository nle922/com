CoM Data Version 2.0.1

Since uploading version 2 to ICPSR, a few additional changes have been made. Rather than upload a whole new version of the dataset, we are providing instructions for how to update the ICPSR file.

1. A new version of the CPP dataset was released. To update with these new places simply run build_CoM_v2.do file making sure the prepare_CPP_data line is commented in. The new version of the CPP data is in the proper directory. 

2. Andrew Holt did some additional cleaning of establishment geographies. These are collected in holt_fixes.do. It should be possible to simply run this on the ICPSR file with no modifications necessary. A call to this code has also been added to the build_CoM_v2.do file.
